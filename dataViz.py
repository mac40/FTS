    The ACF measures the linear predictability of the series at time t, say xt,
    using only the value xs.

    If we can predict xt perfectly from xs through a linear relationship,
    xt = b0 + b1xs, then the correlation will be +1 when b1 > 0,
    and âˆ’1 when b1 < 0

    Hence, we have a rough measure of the ability to forecast the series at
    time t from the value at time s
